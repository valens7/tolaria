# AGENTS.md — Tolaria App

## 1. Development Process

### Local development-root Start Gate

Mora's approved active local repository is **`/Users/valens/Developer/Mora`**.

Before writing source, installing dependencies, running builds, or performing Git
operations, verify that the repository root is this path. A path under Google
Drive, AOV Drive, Baidu Netdisk, Synology Drive, iCloud Drive, Dropbox,
OneDrive, or any other synchronised folder is a **Start Gate Fail**: do not
develop there. Google Drive holds references, prototypes, documents, and
release evidence only; GitHub `main` remains the code authority.

For another application, create its active repository directly under
`/Users/valens/Developer/<AppName>`. Do not use an old Drive mirror or a
temporary validation clone as a development workspace.

### Mandatory-rule exception protocol

Use an exception only when a required service or analyzer remains unavailable after one retry, or when satisfying the rule is technically impossible without increasing security or data-loss risk. The repository owner is the sole approver. Before proceeding, record the blocked command, evidence, affected files, risk, compensating check, approver, and an expiry of at most 72 hours in the Todoist task or final handoff; review and remove the exception within seven days. A preference, deadline, or failing quality gate is not sufficient exception criteria.

### Start working on a task

**Before writing a single line of code:** inspect the configured CodeScene project's current Hotspot and Average Code Health and compare them with `.codescene-thresholds`. Then capture the file-level Code Health score for every existing code file you intend to edit. If the project is already below the threshold, **stop and refactor first** — find the worst files with the MCP, improve them, commit, then start the task. If the gate cannot be restored, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner direction before starting feature work.

- Read task description and all comments fully
- For To Rework: the ❌ QA failed comment tells you exactly what to fix
- Check `docs/adr/` for relevant architecture decisions before structural choices
- Check `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/ABSTRACTIONS.md` for relevant structural information
- For UI tasks: study app visual language and components first. Prioritize reusing existing components, assets, and variables over recreating them.
- If working on a Todoist task, add a comment: `🚀 Starting work on this task. [Brief description of approach]`

### Commits & pushes

- Local work may happen on `main`, in detached HEAD worktrees, or in other temporary local states. The production path is still direct-to-main: final verified work is pushed to `origin/main`, with no PR branch flow.
- Commit every 20–30 min: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- Pre-commit is a lightweight lint gate only. Pre-push runs the full check suite (build + tests + coverage + core Playwright smoke + CodeScene), preferably on three Chunk sidecar lanes for automatic test/coverage work: frontend lint/build/coverage, Rust coverage, and Playwright smoke. The goal is lower wall-clock time than local hooks while keeping each heavy gate isolated; keep local Playwright mainly for authoring, focused reproduction, or sidecar outages.
- CircleCI is the authoritative outer-loop CI/CD system. `.circleci/config.yml` owns validation, native cross-platform release builds, GitHub Release publication, and Pages publication.
- **A task is NOT done until `git push origin main` succeeds.** If the hook blocks: read the error, fix it (clippy, tests, CodeScene, build), commit the fix, push again. If a verified push is impossible, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner direction; do not use `--no-verify` without that recorded approval.

### TDD (mandatory)

Red → Green → Refactor → Commit. One cycle per commit. For bugs: write failing regression test first, then fix. Exception: pure CSS/layout changes.

**Test quality (Kent Beck's Desiderata):** Isolated · Deterministic · Fast · Behavioral · Structure-insensitive · Specific · Predictive. Fix flaky tests first. Prefer E2E over unit tests for user flows.

### Localization (mandatory for UI copy)

All user-facing UI labels/copy must live in `src/lib/locales/en.json` and be translated into every target listed in `lara.yaml`. Exception: when the localization service remains unavailable after one retry, use the mandatory-rule exception protocol above and do not release untranslated copy without repository-owner approval. When adding or changing interface copy:

```bash
pnpm l10n:translate
```

Use `pnpm l10n:translate:force` only when intentionally regenerating existing translations. Commit `src/lib/locales/*.json`, `lara.yaml`/`lara.lock` changes if produced, and verify placeholders/product names stayed intact.

### Product analytics (mandatory for meaningful features)

New features should emit a PostHog event so we can see whether users actually discover and use them. Skip instrumentation when the change has no meaningful user action or when a dedicated event would create noise; record that reason in the completion comment. If the correct instrumentation remains unclear, obtain repository-owner direction before release. Use clear, stable event names, avoid PII or note content, and include only safe metadata that helps evaluate adoption and failures.

When adding or changing a meaningful user-facing feature, include the event name(s) in the Todoist completion comment alongside QA, docs, and code health. If intentionally not instrumenting a feature, explain why in the completion comment.

### Code health (mandatory)

Pre-push compares **Hotspot Code Health** and **Average Code Health** with the exact numeric floors in `.codescene-thresholds` and fails when either score is lower. Pre-commit is lint-only; CodeScene remains mandatory through the file-level review rules below and the pre-push ratchet gate. Thresholds are a **ratchet** — only go up. When pre-push sees improved remote scores, it updates `.codescene-thresholds`, stages it, and stops so you can commit the new floor with normal verified hooks before pushing again. Exception: adding `// eslint-disable`, `#[allow(...)]`, `as any`, or another bypass requires the mandatory-rule exception protocol and repository-owner approval before the edit.

**Release rule:** CodeScene is a before/after gate, not just a final score. Record the starting CodeScene state before edits and the final state after edits. If touched code gets worse, refactor before committing; if the comparison cannot be produced, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner direction.

Do not edit `.codescene-thresholds` to lower the values. If the gate blocks you, improve the code; any proposed exception requires explicit repository-owner approval recorded before the edit.

**CodeScene access order:** use CodeScene MCP tools if available. If MCP is unavailable, use the installed `cs` CLI for file-level review/delta work, and use the CodeScene API (`CODESCENE_PAT` + `CODESCENE_PROJECT_ID`) for project-wide Hotspot/Average threshold checks from `.codescene-thresholds`.

**Before editing any existing code file:** capture its current file-level CodeScene score. After your edits, re-run the same file-level review and verify the score is higher. If the file already starts at `10.0`, it must remain `10.0`. Exception: if the score cannot be obtained after one retry, use the mandatory-rule exception protocol and obtain repository-owner approval before editing.

**New files:** every new **scorable code file** must reach CodeScene score `10.0` before commit. If CodeScene reports `null` / "no scorable code" for a new file, it must still have zero CodeScene findings/warnings. If either requirement cannot be met, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner direction.

**Before every commit:** run CodeScene file-level review on every touched or newly created code file and verify the rule above. Then run `mcp__codescene__pre_commit_code_health_safeguard` for the repository and do not commit unless its quality gates pass. **Boy Scout Rule:** every file you touch must leave with a higher score, unless it was already `10.0`, in which case it must stay `10.0`. If an analyzer or gate is unavailable, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner approval for a documented exception.

**Before the final direct-to-main push:** run `mcp__codescene__analyze_change_set` with `base_ref=origin/main`. This is Tolaria's PR-preflight equivalent: every affected file must be improved or stable, and the overall quality gate must pass. Refactor and repeat if any file is degraded. Exception: if the analysis cannot complete after one retry, use the mandatory-rule exception protocol and obtain repository-owner approval before pushing.

**If CodeScene gate blocks your push:** use `mcp__codescene__code_health_score` to find the worst file, refactor it, commit, push again. Do not wait for laputa-refactor because it is a background loop rather than a substitute for fixing your own regressions; if no in-scope refactor can restore the gate, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner direction.

### Security scan with Codacy (mandatory)

Use Codacy as a security and static-analysis gate before a task is considered releasable.

- **Two required checks:** Codacy's local CLI/MCP analyzes the uncommitted working tree, while the Codacy dashboard also runs server-side tools after a commit is pushed. These are complementary gates. Report each count with its source; if either check is unavailable, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner approval instead of substituting one for the other.
- **What counts as new code:** both a newly created code, test, script, or executable configuration file and any added code in an existing file. Scan the entire containing file, not only the added lines, because Codacy tools can report findings on unchanged lines or at file level after a change.
- **Build the scan manifest:** before each Codacy check, enumerate added and modified tracked paths with `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)" --` and untracked paths with `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`. Classify every code, test, script, and executable configuration path as new or existing, record the manifest in the task evidence, and scan every path individually. Rebuild the manifest immediately before commit so no late-created file is omitted.
- **Before editing existing code:** run a local file scan and record every finding for each code file you intend to touch. Also record that file's findings on Codacy's currently analyzed `main` commit using `codacy_list_files` to resolve the file and `codacy_get_file_issues` to enumerate all paginated results.
- **Local file scan:** use `mcp__codacy__codacy_cli_analyze` with the repository's absolute `rootPath` and an explicit `file`, one touched/new file at a time. If the MCP is unavailable or fails, run `LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 .codacy/cli.sh analyze <path> --format sarif --output /tmp/codacy-<slug>.sarif`. Omit `--tool` so every locally configured analyzer runs. Explicitly inspect every `runs[].results[]` entry in the SARIF output.
- **Analyzer-parity gate:** before creating or modifying code, call `codacy_list_repository_tools` and record the enabled dashboard analyzer name, UUID/generation, configuration mode, and language coverage. Compare that roster with the `runs[].tool.driver` entries produced locally for every language in the scan manifest. Tool names alone are not sufficient: deprecated ESLint/ESLint8 and current ESLint9 are different analyzers, and a local run of Lizard, Opengrep, and Trivy does not prove that dashboard ESLint will be clean. For TypeScript/JavaScript, the passing roster must include the current analyzer that honors `eslint.config.js`, plus every other enabled relevant dashboard tool. If the intended analyzer is disabled, a deprecated analyzer is enabled, or any enabled dashboard analyzer has no equivalent successful local run, analyzer parity fails: stop, correct the Codacy tool configuration, trigger a full reanalysis, and verify parity before code work. A repository-owner-approved exception is required if configuration access is unavailable.
- **Per-file analyzer evidence:** for every new code file, record one result row per expected analyzer with the exact file path, analyzer identity, completion status, and finding counts split into Critical/High/Medium/Minor/Info/unclassified. Missing rows, a skipped/untracked target, an analyzer crash, or an analyzer that silently omits the language is a failed scan, never a zero. If the CLI requires Git discovery, add the file to the index normally before the final scan; do not rely on a directory scan to discover an untracked file.
- **Fail closed on partial scans:** a zero process exit code is not enough. Confirm the expected relevant tools produced SARIF runs and inspect scan logs for crashes, encoding failures, skipped target files, partial analysis, or missing tool output. If any relevant analyzer did not complete, the scan did not pass.
- **Zero-new-findings rule:** added or modified code must introduce no Codacy finding at any severity, including Info/Minor, Warning/Medium, High/Error/Critical, unclassified findings, and findings reported on unchanged lines or at file level because of the change. If this cannot be achieved, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner approval for a documented exception.
- **New code — absolute zero rule:** every new code file and every file containing newly added code must be scanned explicitly after creation or modification and must have exactly zero findings attributable to the new code at every severity. A newly created file must have exactly zero findings in the whole file. For added code in an existing file, any finding on an added line, caused by an added symbol or dependency, or newly appearing at file level fails the gate. `0 Critical + 0 High + 0 Medium + 0 Minor + 0 Info + 0 unclassified` is the only passing result. If a scanner cannot prove this, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner approval before proceeding.
- **Boy Scout Rule for existing files:** after editing, every touched file must have fewer local findings than its recorded baseline; a zero-finding file must stay at zero. Fix every existing Critical/High finding in a touched file; if this cannot be achieved, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner approval for the documented exception.
- **Before every commit:** re-scan every touched/new code file individually and compare the complete SARIF results with its recorded baseline. Do not rely on added-line filtering, repository totals, or `pnpm codacy:gate` alone; if an individual scan cannot complete, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner approval.
- **Post-push dashboard verification:** after `git push origin main`, wait until `codacy_get_repository_with_analysis` reports the exact pushed SHA as `lastAnalysedCommit`. Re-read the enabled-tool roster, paginate `codacy_list_repository_issues` to completion, and filter by each exact manifest path; use file-level MCP queries as supporting detail, not as a substitute for the complete repository issue list because newly created files may not yet resolve through file lookup. Absence from the issue list counts as zero only when the exact SHA is analyzed, the analyzer roster still matches the pre-edit parity record, and the repository reports no analyzer problem. Every new code file must have zero dashboard findings at every severity from every enabled analyzer; every existing touched file must have no new finding and must have fewer findings than its pre-edit dashboard baseline (or remain at zero). If the dashboard reports a finding—even one from a deprecated or misconfigured analyzer—the task remains unfinished until the file is fixed or the analyzer configuration is corrected and a replacement exact SHA is fully reanalyzed. Exception: if verification remains unavailable after one retry, use the mandatory-rule exception protocol and obtain repository-owner approval before release.
- **Repository-wide dashboard counts:** use `codacy_get_repository_with_analysis` for the total and `codacy_list_repository_issues` with full pagination for severity/tool breakdowns. Derive the provider/organization/repository from the Git remote without printing credential-bearing remote URLs; for this repository use `gh` / `refactoringhq` / `tolaria` and branch `main`.
- **Escalation:** if a scanner is unavailable or a finding is demonstrably false, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner approval recorded in the completion comment. Rule suppression requires that same explicit approval and documentation.
- `pnpm codacy:gate` is a required fail-closed added-line safety net in pre-push and CI; it does not replace the touched-file before/after check.

### Check suite (runs on every push)
```bash
pnpm lint && npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm test && pnpm test:coverage  # frontend ≥70%
cargo test && cargo llvm-cov --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --no-clean --fail-under-lines 85
```

Coverage is a release gate, not a vanity metric:
- Frontend coverage must stay ≥70%. Exception: if coverage cannot be measured after one retry because the coverage service is unavailable, use the mandatory-rule exception protocol and obtain repository-owner approval before release.
- Rust line coverage must stay ≥85%. Exception: if coverage cannot be measured after one retry because the coverage service is unavailable, use the mandatory-rule exception protocol and obtain repository-owner approval before release.
- For bug fixes, add a regression test when practical.
- For new behavior, add targeted coverage close to the changed code; do not rely only on broad E2E coverage.

### UI and native QA

**Phase 1 — Playwright (only for core user flows):**

Write Playwright test in `tests/smoke/<slug>.spec.ts` when the feature touches vault open, note create/save/delete, search, wikilink navigation, git commit/push, or conflict resolution. Tag a test with `@smoke` when it protects one of those core pre-push workflows; keep cosmetic or mock-heavy checks in the full regression lane. Prefer `.chunk/run-playwright-smoke.sh` on a Chunk sidecar for the curated smoke lane because local Playwright is expensive; keep `pnpm playwright:smoke` available for focused local reproduction. The curated smoke suite must stay under **5 minutes** when sharded on sidecars. Exception: if a platform outage prevents the smoke test from running after one retry, use the mandatory-rule exception protocol and obtain repository-owner approval before release.

```bash
pnpm dev --port 5201 &
sleep 3
BASE_URL="http://localhost:5201" npx playwright test tests/smoke/<slug>.spec.ts
```

**Phase 2 — Native app QA:**

```bash
pnpm tauri dev &
sleep 10
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/tolaria-qa/scripts/focus-app.sh laputa
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/tolaria-qa/scripts/screenshot.sh /tmp/qa-native.png
```

Use computer-use/browser-control interaction for native UI QA when either tool is present in the current environment: click, hover, drag, select, scroll, and type the way a real user would with the mouse and trackpad. For every UI feature, test the primary mouse-driven path first, then verify each keyboard shortcut or keyboard-first workflow implemented or modified by the task. If neither interaction tool is present, run the scripted focus, screenshot, and shortcut checks and document that limitation.

Use `osascript` for app focus, keyboard shortcuts, and keyboard-specific checks. **⚠️ WKWebView:** if an `osascript keystroke` fails to enter editor text, use computer use for the native editor interaction and rely on Playwright for deterministic text-input coverage. Write the result as a Todoist comment (✅ or ❌), or in the final handoff when no Todoist task exists.

### Release-readiness checklist

Before pushing or moving a task to In Review, verify the release gates and add a **completion comment** to the Todoist task. Exception: when the work has no Todoist task, put the identical evidence in the final handoff and identify it as the release record. The record must include:

- What was implemented (a few lines covering logic and UX/UI).
- QA: what was tested and how (Playwright / native screenshot / osascript).
- Tests/coverage: commands run and final coverage result.
- CodeScene: before/after touched-file checks, the pre-commit safeguard verdict, the final `origin/main` change-set verdict, plus final Hotspot and Average scores after push; every gate must pass `.codescene-thresholds`, or the record must include explicit repository-owner approval for a documented exception.
- Coverage commands passed (`pnpm test:coverage` and `cargo llvm-cov ... --fail-under-lines 85`) or the change is docs-only.
- Codacy: the final scan manifest; local before/after findings for every touched file; confirmation that every relevant local analyzer completed; and post-push dashboard findings after Codacy analyzed the exact pushed SHA. Confirm fewer findings in existing files (or zero stayed zero), exactly zero local and dashboard findings in every new code file, and zero findings attributable to added code in existing files at every severity.
- Localization: any user-facing copy lives in `src/lib/locales/en.json`, `pnpm l10n:translate` was run, and `pnpm l10n:validate` passes. If no copy changed, say “Localization: no UI copy changes”.
- PostHog: meaningful new user actions/events are instrumented with safe metadata; noisy/minor changes explicitly say “PostHog: no event needed because …”.
- Refactoring: any files refactored to meet the CodeScene gate, or "none needed".
- ADRs: any new/updated ADRs, or "none".
- Docs: any updated docs (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ABSTRACTIONS.md`, etc.), or "none".
- Demo vault dirt checked: `git status --short -- demo-vault demo-vault-v2` is empty unless fixture changes are intentional.

### ADRs & docs

ADRs live in `docs/adr/`. Create one in the same commit as the code. Preserve existing ADRs by creating a new one that supersedes them; editing an existing ADR requires an explicit repository-owner request. Use `/create-adr`. **When:** new dependency, storage strategy, platform target, core abstraction, cross-cutting pattern. **Not for:** bug fixes, styling, refactors.

After any Tauri command, new component/hook, data model change, or new integration: update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ABSTRACTIONS.md`, and/or `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` in the same commit.

## 2. Product Rules

### Demo vault hygiene (`demo-vault/`, `demo-vault-v2/`)

Default to `demo-vault-v2/` for testing.

- Treat `demo-vault/` and `demo-vault-v2/` as disposable QA fixtures unless the task explicitly changes demo content.
- If you create untracked notes, attachments, or other temporary files there for testing, delete them before the task is complete.
- If you modify tracked demo-vault files only to test or QA behavior, revert those edits before the final commit.
- Before declaring a task done, make sure `git status --short -- demo-vault demo-vault-v2` is empty unless demo fixture changes are part of the task.
- If a fresh run starts and the only local dirt is inside `demo-vault/` or `demo-vault-v2/`, clean those paths first and continue. That case is recoverable QA residue, not a blocker.

### User vault (`~/Laputa/`)

Default to `demo-vault-v2/`. If you must use `~/Laputa/` for testing:
- Do not commit or push test notes to the remote vault unless the repository owner explicitly identifies that content as an intended deliverable.
- **Delete all test notes from disk** when done — do not leave untitled or temporary notes on the filesystem. Run `cd ~/Laputa && git checkout -- . && git clean -fd` to restore the vault to its last committed state.
- **Rationale:** test notes pollute the local vault over time, making it a collection of nonsensical untitled files. Keep the vault clean on disk as well as on the remote; any intended fixture exception requires explicit repository-owner approval.

### UI components — mandatory rules

Use shadcn/ui components for user-facing interactive elements instead of raw HTML form elements (`<input>`, `<select>`, `<button>`, native `<input type="date">`, etc.). If no suitable shadcn or existing app component exists, stop and obtain explicit repository-owner design approval before introducing a raw control.

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Text input | `Input` from shadcn/ui |
| Dropdown/select | `Select` from shadcn/ui |
| Date picker | `Calendar` + `Popover` from shadcn/ui (NOT native `<input type="date">`) |
| Button | `Button` from shadcn/ui |
| Autocomplete/combobox | Reuse existing combobox components from the app (check `src/components/`) |
| Wikilink picker | Reuse the wikilink autocomplete component already used in the editor and Properties panel |
| Emoji picker | Reuse the emoji picker component already used for note/type icons |
| Color picker | Reuse the color swatch picker used for type customization |
| Toggle/switch | `Switch` or `ToggleGroup` from shadcn/ui |
| Dialog/modal | `Dialog` from shadcn/ui |

**Component search trigger:** when the requested interaction does not map to a component in the table above, search `src/components/` by the interaction name and ARIA role before building a component. **Visual language:** new UI must follow Tolaria's existing components and design tokens; a deliberate exception requires explicit repository-owner design approval recorded through the mandatory-rule exception protocol.

## 3. Reference

### macOS / Tauri gotchas

- `Option+N` → special chars on macOS. Use `e.code` or `Cmd+N`
- Tauri menu accelerators: `MenuItemBuilder::new(label).accelerator("CmdOrCtrl+1")`
- `app.set_menu()` replaces the ENTIRE menu bar — include all submenus
- `mock-tauri.ts` silently swallows Tauri calls — not a substitute for native testing

### QA scripts

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/tolaria-qa/scripts/focus-app.sh Tolaria
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/tolaria-qa/scripts/screenshot.sh /tmp/out.png
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/tolaria-qa/scripts/shortcut.sh "command" "s"
```

### Diagrams

Prefer Mermaid (`flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`). ASCII only for spatial wireframe layouts.
