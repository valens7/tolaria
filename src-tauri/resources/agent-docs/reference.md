# Docs Maintenance

Source: reference/docs-maintenance.md
URL: /reference/docs-maintenance

# Docs Maintenance

The public docs live in the app repo so documentation changes can ship with behavior changes.

## Update Docs When You Change

- A Tauri command.
- A new component or hook that changes user behavior.
- A data model or frontmatter convention.
- Git, AI, onboarding, or release behavior.
- Public release pages, download metadata, or updater channels.
- Platform support.
- Keyboard shortcuts.
- Stable release highlights.
- Examples in the Getting Started vault.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Make the code change.
2. Update the matching concept, guide, or reference page.
3. Add a troubleshooting page if the change creates a new failure mode.
4. Run `pnpm docs:build`.
5. Check the home page, search, release/download links, and changed docs pages in a browser.

## Release Communication Check

For each stable release:

1. Use the public release history as the source of truth for what shipped.
2. Map every user-facing highlight to a concept, guide, reference, or troubleshooting page.
3. Add or refresh a Getting Started vault example when the feature is best learned by opening a real file.
4. Review the landing page separately and promote only the capabilities that explain Tolaria's durable value.
5. Remove instructions for features that were withheld from the final release.

## Page Types

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Start | Helps a new user get into the app. |
| Concepts | Explains mental models. |
| Guides | Teaches workflows. |
| Reference | Gives stable facts and tables. |
| Troubleshooting | Starts from a symptom and ends with recovery. |

## Review Checklist

- Does the page describe current behavior?
- Does it mention macOS primary and Windows/Linux supported-early status when platform support matters?
- Are links relative and VitePress-compatible?
- Can a user discover the page with local search?
- Does the Getting Started vault demonstrate the workflow when an example would be clearer than prose?

# File Layout

Source: reference/file-layout.md
URL: /reference/file-layout

# File Layout

Tolaria is not opinionated about folder structure. It finds notes recursively across the whole vault, stores new notes in the root by default, and uses types and relationships for real organization.

```txt
my-vault/
  project-alpha.md
  weekly-review.md
  research/
    source-notes.md
  attachments/
    diagram.png
    source.pdf
  project.md
  person.md
  views/
    active-projects.yml
```

## Root Notes

Tolaria works well with a flat vault. Folders are optional and can be useful for compatibility with other tools, but they are not required for people, projects, topics, or any other note category.

Type is not inferred from folder location. It comes from frontmatter, and relationships are expressed with wikilinks in fields. That is what Tolaria uses for the sidebar, Properties panel, search, custom views, and neighborhood navigation.

## Special Folders

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `views/` | Saved custom views. |
| `attachments/` | Images and other attached files. |

PDFs, images, and other non-Markdown files stay as normal files. Folder browsing can show them in place, and Settings controls whether PDFs, images, and unsupported files appear in All Notes.

Whiteboards are Markdown files with durable tldraw data, so they belong with notes rather than in `attachments/`.

Spreadsheets are also Markdown files. A note with `_display: sheet` stores ordinary frontmatter plus a CSV-like body and opens in the sheet editor.

Type definitions are Markdown notes with `type: Type` in frontmatter. New type documents are normal notes, and existing type documents in older folders still work.

## Git Files

If the vault is a Git repository, `.git/` belongs to Git. Tolaria reads Git state but does not treat `.git/` as notes.

---

# Frontmatter Fields

Source: reference/frontmatter-fields.md
URL: /reference/frontmatter-fields

# Frontmatter Fields

Tolaria uses conventions instead of a required schema.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The note's entity type. |
| `status` | Lifecycle state. |
| `icon` | Per-note icon. |
| `url` | External URL. |
| `date` | Single date. |
| `belongs_to` | Parent relationship. |
| `related_to` | Lateral relationship. |
| `has` | Contained relationship. |
| `_width` | Per-note editor width override. |
| `_display` | Display mode. Omit for text notes; use `sheet` for spreadsheet notes. |
| `_icon`, `_color` | Type or note appearance metadata. `_icon` values use Phosphor icon names in kebab-case, emoji, or HTTP(S) image URLs. |
| `_sidebar_label`, `_order` | Type sidebar label and order. |
| `_pinned_properties` | Properties pinned in the editor inline bar for notes of a type. |
| `_list_properties_display` | Properties shown as note-list chips or columns for notes of a type. |
| `_sheet` | Sheet-note presentation metadata such as grid settings, column widths, row heights, and cell formatting. |

## Custom Fields

You can add your own fields. If a field contains wikilinks, Tolaria can treat it as a relationship.

## System Fields

Fields starting with `_` are reserved for system behavior and hidden from standard property editing. They remain plain YAML, so they can still be inspected or changed in raw mode when needed.

Nested keys under a system field are also system-owned. For example, `_sheet.cells.B6.num_fmt` belongs to the sheet editor and should not appear as a normal user property.

# Release Channels

Source: reference/release-channels.md
URL: /reference/release-channels

# Release Channels

Tolaria publishes Stable and Alpha release metadata to GitHub Pages.

## Stable

Stable follows manually promoted releases. This is the right channel for normal use.

The stable updater metadata lives at:

```txt
/stable/latest.json
```

The public download page points at the latest stable release.

## Alpha

Alpha follows pushes to `main`. It receives fixes and features earlier, but it can be rougher than Stable.

The alpha updater metadata lives at:

```txt
/alpha/latest.json
```

Compatibility endpoints also point to the alpha metadata:

```txt
/latest.json
/latest-canary.json
```

## Before Switching

Commit or push important vault changes before changing release channel or installing an update. Your notes are local files, but a clean Git state makes recovery simpler.

# Spreadsheet File Format

Source: reference/spreadsheet-format.md
URL: /reference/spreadsheet-format

# Spreadsheet File Format

Sheet notes are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter and a CSV-like body. The note uses `_display: sheet` when it should open in the spreadsheet editor. The `type` field remains ordinary semantic metadata.

For editing workflows, see [Use Spreadsheets](/guides/use-spreadsheets). For formula syntax and function references, see [Spreadsheet Formulas](/reference/spreadsheet-functions).

## Structure

```md

type: Project
_display: sheet
tags:
  - planning
_sheet:
  show_grid_lines: true
  frozen_rows: 1
  frozen_columns: 1
  columns:

Net,=B2-B3,=C2-C3,=D2-D3,=SUM(B4:D4)
Growth,,=(C4-B4)/B4,=(D4-C4)/C4,=(E4-B4)/B4
```

The frontmatter stores note metadata. The body stores rows and cells. There is no Markdown table wrapper, fenced code block, or embedded workbook blob.

## Frontmatter

All ordinary Tolaria fields remain available:

- `type`
- `status`
- `date`
- `tags`
- `url`
- relationship fields such as `belongs_to`, `related_to`, and custom wikilink properties

The `_display: sheet` field is the display-as marker. Omit it for ordinary text notes.

The `_sheet` key is reserved for spreadsheet presentation metadata. It follows the same system-field convention as other underscore-prefixed Tolaria fields: hidden from normal property editing, but visible and editable in raw source.

## Body

The body is CSV-like text:

- rows are separated by line breaks
- cells are separated by commas
- cells containing commas, quotes, or line breaks are quoted
- quotes inside quoted cells are escaped by doubling them
- empty trailing rows and columns may be omitted on save

Any cell whose input starts with `=` is treated as a formula. Other cells are treated as literal values.

## `_sheet` Metadata

Tolaria stores spreadsheet presentation state in `_sheet` as plain YAML.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `show_grid_lines` | Whether grid lines are shown. |
| `frozen_rows` | Number of frozen rows from the top. |
| `frozen_columns` | Number of frozen columns from the left. |
| `columns.<column>.width` | Custom column width, keyed by column letter such as `A` or `BC`. |
| `rows."<row>".height` | Custom row height, keyed by one-based row number. |
| `cells.<cell>.num_fmt` | Number format code for a cell. |
| `cells.<cell>.bold` | Bold text style. |
| `cells.<cell>.italic` | Italic text style. |
| `cells.<cell>.underline` | Underline text style. |
| `cells.<cell>.strike` | Strikethrough text style. |
| `cells.<cell>.font_size` | Font size. |
| `cells.<cell>.font_color` | Text color. |
| `cells.<cell>.fill_color` | Cell fill color. |
| `cells.<cell>.horizontal_align` | Horizontal alignment. |
| `cells.<cell>.vertical_align` | Vertical alignment. |
| `cells.<cell>.wrap_text` | Text wrapping. |
| `cells.<cell>.border_top` | Top border style. |
| `cells.<cell>.border_right` | Right border style. |
| `cells.<cell>.border_bottom` | Bottom border style. |
| `cells.<cell>.border_left` | Left border style. |

Cell metadata is keyed by A1-style cell addresses such as `A1`, `B12`, or `AA30`.

Border values are stored as a style name with an optional color, for example:

```yaml
border_bottom: "thin #d0d7de"
```

## Number Formats

Number formats are stored in `num_fmt` using spreadsheet-style format codes. Common examples:

| Format | Example output |
| --- | --- |
| `#,##0` | `1,250` |
| `#,##0.00` | `1,250.50` |
| `0.00%` | `12.35%` |
| `$#,##0.00` | `$1,250.50` |
| `yyyy-mm-dd` | `2026-06-15` |

These formats affect presentation, not the underlying cell input in the CSV body.

## Markdown Style Import

When Tolaria imports a non-formula CSV cell, simple Markdown wrappers can seed initial styles:

| Cell text | Stored value | Style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `**Revenue**` | `Revenue` | bold |
| `_Estimate_` | `Estimate` | italic |
| `***Total***` | `Total` | bold and italic |
| `~~Removed~~` | `Removed` | strike |

After save, the style belongs in `_sheet` metadata and the body keeps the unwrapped text.

## Wikilinks

Non-formula cells can store normal Tolaria wikilinks:

```csv
Account,Source
Newsletter,[[newsletter-revenue]]
Sponsors,[[sponsorship-pipeline]]
```

Formula cells can reference another sheet note with Tolaria's cross-sheet syntax:

```txt
=[[newsletter-revenue]].B5
=ROUND([[business-plan]].$E$12, 2)
=[[device]].power.watts
=[[launch-brief]].2
```

Cross-sheet cell references resolve another sheet note by wikilink target, then read a single A1-style cell. Frontmatter references resolve one note by wikilink target, then read a scalar property path after the dot. Numeric line references such as `[[launch-brief]].2` read one frontmatter-stripped raw body line and preserve commas as text. Missing, ambiguous, circular, very deep, or non-scalar references are treated as unresolved and surface as spreadsheet errors.

## Guidance For Agents And Scripts

When editing a sheet note programmatically:

- preserve the YAML frontmatter delimiter and ordinary Tolaria fields
- keep `_display: sheet` when the file should display as a spreadsheet
- keep spreadsheet presentation state under `_sheet`
- parse and serialize the body as CSV, not by splitting on every comma manually
- preserve formulas as formulas, including `[[sheet]].A1`, `[[note]].property.path`, and `[[note]].1` references
- avoid converting formulas to their displayed values
- quote CSV cells when they contain commas, quotes, or line breaks
- do not add workbook tabs inside one note; create another note with `_display: sheet` instead
- do not store opaque binary workbook state in the Markdown file

If a script cannot safely preserve `_sheet`, it should leave that block untouched and edit only the CSV body cells it understands.

# Spreadsheet Formulas

Source: reference/spreadsheet-functions.md
URL: /reference/spreadsheet-functions

# Spreadsheet Formulas

Formula cells start with `=` and are evaluated by IronCalc through Tolaria's sheet editor.

Tolaria adds vault-aware sheet references on top of the normal spreadsheet formula model. Everything else should be treated as IronCalc formula behavior. IronCalc aims for Excel-compatible formulas, but the upstream project is still evolving, so verify advanced formulas against the IronCalc docs when precision matters.

The same `[[note]].field` target forms are also available to HTML block vault expressions. Use [Vault Expressions](/reference/vault-expressions) for `{{...}}` syntax and HTML formatting helpers.

## Basic Syntax

| Syntax | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `=B2+B3-B4` | Arithmetic over cells. |
| `=SUM(B2:D2)` | Function call over a range. |
| `=ROUND(E6, 2)` | Function call with arguments. |
| `=IF(E6>0, "Up", "Down")` | Conditional expression. |
| `=$B$2` | Absolute column and row reference. |
| `=B$2` | Relative column, absolute row. |
| `=$B2` | Absolute column, relative row. |
| `=B2:D10` | A range in the current sheet note. |
| `="Q" & 1` | Text concatenation. |

Use parentheses when a model depends on precedence:

```txt
=(B2+B3-B4)/B5
```

## Tolaria Note References

Tolaria supports wikilink cell references for values that live in another sheet note:

```txt
=[[newsletter-revenue]].B5
=SUM(B2:D2)+[[sponsorship-pipeline]].E12
=ROUND([[business-plan]].$E$12, 2)
=[[launch-brief]].2
```

The target inside `[[...]]` resolves like a normal Tolaria wikilink. The cell address after the dot uses A1 notation.

Absolute markers follow spreadsheet copy behavior:

| Reference | Copy behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `[[revenue]].B5` | row and column can shift |
| `[[revenue]].$B$5` | row and column stay fixed |
| `[[revenue]].B$5` | row fixed, column can shift |
| `[[revenue]].$B5` | column fixed, row can shift |

Cross-sheet cell references currently resolve single cells. Keep range formulas inside one sheet note until cross-note ranges are explicitly supported.

Formulas can also read scalar frontmatter properties from a specific note:

```txt
=[[device.md]].power.watts
=[[project-alpha]].status
=[[book-notes/the-design-of-everyday-things.md]].rating
```

The target resolves like a wikilink, and the dot path reads nested frontmatter keys. Numbers, booleans, and strings become formula literals. Missing notes, ambiguous note targets, missing properties, arrays, maps, and other non-scalar values resolve to `#N/A`.

A first segment that looks like an A1 cell address, such as `B2`, is treated as a cross-sheet cell reference. Use property names that do not collide with A1 notation for frontmatter formulas.

Formulas can read one raw Markdown body line from any note with numeric dot notation:

```txt
=[[launch-brief]].1
=[[launch-brief]].2
```

Line references exclude YAML frontmatter, are 1-based, and preserve commas as text. `[[note]].A1` still means grid/cell access and can split comma-separated content; `[[note]].1` means the whole first body line.

## Autocomplete Functions

Tolaria's formula autocomplete exposes the implemented function catalog from the bundled IronCalc engine. The current catalog has 195 functions.

The dropdown shows a small ranked set of matches while you type. Keep typing to narrow the result list. Function names with digits and dots, such as `BIN2DEC` and `ERFC.PRECISE`, are supported.

# Vault Expressions

Vault expressions let rendered content read values from Tolaria notes. The `{{...}}` template form currently runs in HTML blocks. Sheet formulas use the same `[[note]].field` reference forms inside `=` formulas, but spreadsheet calculations still use IronCalc functions.

## Reference Syntax

| --- | --- |
| `{{status}}` | Current note property. |
| `{{this.status}}` | Current note property with explicit `this`. |
| `{{[[project-alpha]].status}}` | Scalar property from another note. |
| `{{[[device]].power.watts}}` | Nested scalar frontmatter path. |
| `{{[[essay]].has_notes}}` | Relationship or array property as comma-separated text. |
| `{{[[essay]].title}}` | Referenced note title. |
| `{{[[budget]].B5}}` | Single cell from a sheet note. |
| `{{[[brief]].2}}` | Second raw body line from another note. |

Wikilink targets resolve like normal Tolaria links, so they can use filenames, paths, or note titles when those targets are unambiguous.

Line references are 1-based and exclude YAML frontmatter. `[[note]].A1` means grid or cell access and may split comma-separated content. `[[note]].1` means the whole first body line, preserving commas as text.

## Values

Properties can resolve to strings, numbers, booleans, `null`, or arrays of strings, numbers, and booleans. Arrays render as comma-separated text unless you pass them to `json(...)`.

Unresolved expressions remain visible as escaped placeholders, such as `{{missing_property}}`, so broken dashboards fail visibly instead of silently showing the wrong value.

Expression output is escaped as text by default. A property value such as `<strong>Draft</strong>` displays as text, not as live HTML.

## Formatting Helpers

| Helper | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `upper(value)` | `{{upper(status)}}` |
| `lower(value)` | `{{lower(status)}}` |
| `title(value)` | `{{title(status)}}` |
| `trim(value)` | `{{trim(name)}}` |
| `truncate(value, length, suffix?)` | `{{truncate(summary, 120)}}` |
| `replace(value, from, to)` | `{{replace(status, "_", " ")}}` |
| `round(value, digits?)` | `{{round(score, 1)}}` |
| `formatNumber(value, digits?)` | `{{formatNumber(revenue, 0)}}` |
| `formatPercent(value, digits?)` | `{{formatPercent(conversion_rate, 1)}}` |
| `formatCurrency(value, currency, digits?)` | `{{formatCurrency(amount, "USD", 0)}}` |
| `formatDate(value, format?)` | `{{formatDate(publish_date, "long")}}` |
| `default(value, fallback)` | `{{default(status, "Draft")}}` |
| `isEmpty(value)` | `{{isEmpty(owner)}}` |
| `json(value)` | `{{json([[essay]].has_notes)}}` |

`formatDate` supports `short`, `medium`, `long`, and `YYYY-MM-DD`. Formatting uses the app locale when available.

The only operator is `+`, which concatenates text:

```html
<p>{{first_name + " " + last_name}}</p>
```

Vault expressions do not run arbitrary JavaScript. They do not support loops, mutation, user-defined functions, raw HTML interpolation, or remote data access.

## Structured JSON

Use `json(...)` when an HTML block script needs data instead of already-rendered text:

```html
<script type="application/json" id="notes-data">
{{json([[essay]].has_notes)}}
</script>
```

For scalar values, `json(...)` returns the JSON representation of that value. For a wikilink or a relationship array made of wikilinks, it returns note summary objects:

```json
{
  "title": "Acceleration whiplash",
  "target": "acceleration-whiplash",
  "path": "/vault/acceleration-whiplash.md",
  "status": "Evergreened",
  "raw": "[[acceleration-whiplash]]",
  "deepLink": "tolaria://refactoring-vault/acceleration-whiplash.md"
}
```

The JSON is escaped so it cannot close the surrounding script tag. Put it in a non-executable script tag, then parse it from a `scripts="sandboxed"` HTML block when you need to build markup with standard DOM APIs.

## Sheet Formula Parity

The same note target forms work in sheet formulas:

```txt
=[[newsletter-revenue]].B5
=[[project-alpha]].status
=[[launch-brief]].2
```

# View Filters

View filters define saved lists of notes.

## Common Filter Ideas

| Goal | Filter direction |
| --- | --- |
| Active projects | `type` is Project and `status` is Active |
| Drafts | `type` is Article and `status` is Draft |
| People follow-up | `type` is Person and date is before today |
| Recent work | modified date is within a recent range |

## Sorting

Useful sorts include:

- Recently modified first.
- Title ascending.
- Status ascending.
- A custom property ascending or descending.

## Operators

Saved views can combine filters for text, dates, relationship fields, and frontmatter values. Relative date expressions are useful for views such as notes changed this week or people that need follow-up.

Regex filters are available for power-user cases. Keep them narrow and test them on a small view first.

## Keep Views Focused

A view should answer one recurring question. If it becomes too broad, split it into two views.

You can also customize view appearance with the same kind of icon and color controls used by types.
